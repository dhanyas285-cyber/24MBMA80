##  Dataset (50–100 Records)

Columns:

* **Customer** → `customer_id, customer_name, gender, age`
* **Service** → `service_id, service_name, category (hair, skin, spa, grooming)`
* **Booking** → `booking_id, booking_date, booking_time, amount_spent, duration, staff_id, status`

---

##  Approach

* **PySpark Core** → Revenue per category, average booking duration
